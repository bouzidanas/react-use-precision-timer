## Description

A versatile precision timer hook for React. Doubles as a stopwatch.

See the [live demo](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-demo--page).

## Usage

```jsx
import { useTimer } from 'react-use-precision-timer';
```

### Timer With Callback

In your function component:

```jsx
const timerOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
  return {
    // The callback will be called every 1000 milliseconds.
    delay: 1000,
    callback: () => console.log('Boom'),
  };
}, []);
const timer = useTimer(timerOptions);
```

In a handler or effect:

```jsx
timer.start();
```

Pass the hook a [TimerOptions](#timeroptions) object to configure a timer's delay and the callback called when it fires. By default, the timer repeats.

You can also configure whether it should only run once (`runOnce`), whether it should fire immediately (`fireImmediately`), and whether it should start immediately (`startImmediately`).

The hook returns a [Timer](#timer) object. Using this, you can `start`, `stop`, `pause`, and `resume` a timer, and there are numerous accessors available for everything under the sun, from elapsed time to start time to whether the timer is running or paused.

Calling start while a timer is already running will restart it.

See all the ways to use a [Timer](#timer) below.

### One Time Delay

```jsx
// Two second delay, only runs one time, starts immediately
const timerOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
  return {
    delay: 2000,
    callback: () => console.log('Boom'),
    runOnce: true,
    startImmediately: true,
  };
}, []);
useTimer(timerOptions);
```

This will call the callback after the provided delay, and only once. Alternatively, you can use the [useDelay](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usedelay--page) hook, which encapsulates these options.

### Stopwatch Timer

```jsx
// With no delay or callback, a timer acts as a stopwatch
const stopwatch = useTimer();
```

A timer with no `delay` option behaves exactly as a stopwatch. It will run forever until you pause or stop it, tracking the elapsed time.

You can `start`, `stop`, `pause`, and `resume` a stopwatch timer. You can retrieve elapsed time, total pause time, and more.

Alternatively, you can use the [useStopwatch](https://justinmahar.github.io/react-use-precision-timer/?path=/story/docs-usestopwatch--page) hook, which encapsulates this option.

## Signature

#### TimerOptions

All properties are optional.

| Property         | Type                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| delay            | `number`                             | Amount of time to wait before firing the timer, in milliseconds. Use `undefined` or `0` if you'd like the timer to behave as a stopwatch, never firing.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| callback         | `(overdueCallCount: number) => void` | The callback to call when the timer fires. Must provide a `delay` for the timer to fire. If you'd like, you can determine if any calls were missed by checking the `overdueCallCount` argument. This value will indicate how many calls were missed due to a very short timer delay (< 10ms) or time-consuming callback. |
| runOnce          | `boolean`                            | Use `true` to only run the timer once, `false` otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| fireImmediately  | `boolean`                            | Use `true` if the timer should fire immediately, calling the provided callback when starting. Use `false` otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| startImmediately | `boolean`                            | Use `true` if the timer should start immediately, `false` if you'd like to call `start()` yourself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Low Delays, Expensive Callbacks, and Overdue Calls

Very low delays (less than 10ms) and expensive callback operations can sometimes
cause the timer to not fire fast enough.

As a failsafe, callback calls will be skipped when the timer can't keep up, allowing it to recover.

If you'd like, you can check the `overdueCallCount` argument in your callback to determine how many calls were missed and account for those missed calls.

### Return

The hook returns a [Timer](#timer) object. See below.

### Timer

The Timer object returned by the hook has the following properties.

| getLastFireTime            | `() => number`  | The last time the timer fired and the callback was called, in milliseconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), or `-1` if it hasn't fired yet or there is no `delay`.                                                     |

| getPeriodElapsedPausedTime | `() => number`  | Return the amount of time elapsed in milliseconds while paused in the current period. This will be the elapsed time since the timer last fired, or since it started if it hasn't fired yet. Returns `0` if never paused since starting or last firing. |
| getElapsedResumedTime      | `() => number`  | Return the total amount of time elapsed in milliseconds since the timer was last resumed, or since it was started if never paused. Returns `0` if the timer is stopped.                                                                                |

## How It Works

The timer uses the start time and provided `delay` option to calculate the next fire time, and `setTimeout()` to home in on the exact fire time needed.

After firing, the next fire time is calculated by adding the `delay` to the previous fire time. This is how the timer avoids "wandering" from the start time due to inconsistencies with `setTimeout()`.

If timer events become overdue due to very short delays (less than 10ms) and expensive callback operations, some callback calls may be skipped to allow the timer to recover, although you can disable this failsafe with the `fireOverdueCallbacks` option.

When used as a stopwatch (no `delay`), no timeouts are used.
