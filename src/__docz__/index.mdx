**A versatile precision timer hook for React. Doubles as a stopwatch.**

üëÅÔ∏è **[Live Demo](/demo)**

## Overview

A React timer hook that calls the provided callback at regular intervals. Can be used as a stopwatch, too.

It's accurate, precise, and includes a rich set of options, functionality, and accessors.

### Features include:

- **‚è∞ Timeout and timestamp based**
  - Based on `setTimeout()` and Unix times, not ticks.
- **üéØ Accurate and precise**
  - Perfect mean accuracy with no wandering, with sub 10ms callback precision.
- **üí™ Doesn't choke under pressure**
  - Resilient to expensive callbacks and low timer delays.
- **üß∞ Versatile**
  - Can be used as a timer, one-time delay, or stopwatch. Additional options available.
- **‚èØÔ∏è Pause and resume**
  - Supports pausing, and tracks cumulative elapsed pause time between resumes.
- **üåû Accessors for everything**
  - Includes getters for everything under the sun! Know all the things.

## Installation

```
npm i react-use-precision-timer
```

## Quick Start

### Repeating Timer

```jsx
import { useTimer } from 'react-use-precision-timer';
```

In your function component: 

```jsx
// The callback will be called every 1000 milliseconds.
const timer = useTimer({ delay: 1000, callback: () => console.log("Boom") });
```

In a handler or effect: 

```jsx
timer.start();
```

The following functions can be used to control the [Timer](/useTimer#timer):

- `timer.start()` - Start the timer. If already started, will restart the timer.
- `timer.stop()` - Stop the timer.
- `timer.pause()` - Pause the timer.
- `timer.resume()` - Resume the timer.

Refer to [Timer](/useTimer#timer) for all available functions, including getters for elapsed times.

### One-Time Delay

If you'd like to run a callback after a one-time delay, use the helper hook [useDelay](/useDelay):

```jsx
import { useDelay } from 'react-use-precision-timer';
```

```jsx
// Call once after 1000ms.
useDelay(1000, () => console.log("Boom"));
```

The provided callback will be called only once after the provided delay.

### Stopwatch

The timer also functions as a stopwatch when no delay is provided. You can use the helper hook [useStopwatch](/useStopwatch):

```jsx
import { useStopwatch } from 'react-use-precision-timer';
```

```jsx
const stopwatch = useStopwatch();
```

Use `start()`, `stop()`, `pause()`, and `resume()` to control the stopwatch.

Stopwatch is a [Timer](/useTimer#timer) object. Refer to Timer's getters to retrieve elapsed running time, paused time, and so forth.

Calling start while a stopwatch is already running will restart it.

### Other Usage

See [useTimer](/useTimer) for all other hook options and timer functions.

## TypeScript

Type definitions have been included for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support.
